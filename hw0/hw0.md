# HW0

This is a short simple homework to make sure your gitlab and chisubmit is all set up and running.

## Due
4/4/19 2:00 pm CST

## Submission Instructions
 - Add your answer in a file titled zooFSDB.md in the hws/hw0 directory in your project directory. You will lose points for the wrong file name and the wrong directory. You do not need to use markdown; text only is fine, but the file extension should be md
 - Your solution will need to be merged and pushed into your master branch (points here also).
 - You will submit via chisubmit for hw0 (0 points if this is not done).

## Instructions
Write a short description (about 1 paragraph) how you would write an application to manage data in a filesystem for a simple Zoo application about the following
things. You should describe how files are organized in folders, and how each file would contain the records/data. 
 - Animals (with each animal having a name, age, species, and a cage)
 - Cage (with each cage having a name, building, lastFeedTime, and zookeeper name)
 - Zookeeper (with a name, age)

In addition describe the following operations very briefly (1-2 sentence max):
 - Add animal
 - Move all snakes to a new building
 - Find the hungriest cage (e.g. the cage that has gone the longest since last feeding)

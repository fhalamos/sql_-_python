Please provide 1/2-1 page write up, outlining 1) what technical things (e.g. ssh, VMs, etc) you wish you knew at the start of the quarter or how you wish technical concepts would have been taught/reinforced at the start of the class; 2) what technical concepts do you feel like you still do not have a good grip on at this point in the quarter; and 3) what database concepts you wish we covered or covered more (or if you feel none, what concepts did you enjoy the most). Add the write up to this directory as either a md, pdf, or txt file.
